## System Architecture

### Modular Architecture
- Backend services are divided into interchangeable modules:
  - Keyword Research
  - Site Audit
  - Backlink Analysis
  - Rank Tracking
  - Content Optimization
  - Competitor Analysis
  - Local SEO
  - Reporting

- Each module exposes RESTful APIs and can be independently developed, tested, and deployed.
- Frontend is a React.js or Vue.js SPA with role-based dashboards and interactive visualizations.
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) for scalable crawling, storage, and ML workloads.

## Example User Workflow

1. User enters domain → runs instant technical audit → receives SEO health score and priority tasks.
2. Inputs seed keywords → generates cluster-based content strategy.
3. Adds competitor domains → identifies keyword gaps and backlink opportunities.
4. Receives automated alerts for ranking drops or penalties.

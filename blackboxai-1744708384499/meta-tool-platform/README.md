# AI-Powered Meta-Tool Platform

## Overview

This project aims to build a scalable, AI-powered platform that enables users to create, customize, and deploy any type of digital tool through natural language prompts. The system acts as a "meta-tool" that dynamically generates specialized tools based on user requirements, domain expertise, and integration with existing APIs/services.

## Core Features

- Modular, domain-agnostic architecture supporting plug-and-play components
- Natural language interface for tool specification and generation
- AI engine leveraging GPT-4 for requirement extraction and code scaffolding
- Integration hub for connecting to third-party APIs and services
- Testing suite for auto-generated unit tests and security audits
- User customization with no-code editor and collaboration features
- Marketplace for publishing and monetizing generated tools

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP

- Basic UI to input natural language prompts
- Backend AI processing to extract features and generate simple React + Tailwind code scaffolding
- Display generated code snippets to users
- Support for simple tools like calculators, SEO checkers

### Phase 2: Advanced AI & Integrations

- Integrate LangChain for AI workflows
- Add backend microservices generation (FastAPI/GraphQL)
- Connect to APIs (OpenAI, AWS, Google Cloud)
- Add vector database for blueprint retrieval

### Phase 3: Marketplace & Collaboration

- No-code drag-and-drop editor
- Git-like version control for teams
- Marketplace for tool publishing and revenue sharing

## Getting Started

This repository will contain frontend and backend code for the platform prototype.

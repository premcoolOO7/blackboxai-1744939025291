# All-in-One Security Toolkit for Modern Websites

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive security toolkit integrating critical security and encryption tools into a single platform. It prioritizes ease of use, compliance, and defense against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Core Features

- Authentication: Password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), JWT management
- Encryption: TLS/SSL auto-configuration, AES-256 data-at-rest encryption, WireGuard for data-in-transit
- Network Security: Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, rate limiting, DDoS protection
- Monitoring: Real-time intrusion detection, log analysis
- Compliance: GDPR/CCPA helpers, automated audit reporting
- Security Headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
- Password Strength Analyzer with breach-check API integration
- SQL/NoSQL Injection sanitization middleware
- Cookie security with SameSite and HttpOnly flags
- Vulnerability scanner for dependencies (npm/pip)
- Automated security.txt generator

## Architecture

```
[User] --> [React Dashboard] --> [Express Backend] --> [Security Modules & APIs]
                                   |
                                   --> [PostgreSQL with TDE]
                                   --> [Cloudflare WAF]
                                   --> [HaveIBeenPwned API]
                                   --> [VirusTotal API]
```

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP

- React dashboard with security health scoring
- Express backend with password hashing, input sanitization, security headers middleware
- Basic compliance helpers and audit reporting
- Integration with HaveIBeenPwned for password breach checks

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- MFA and JWT management
- TLS/SSL auto-configuration with Let's Encrypt
- WAF rules and rate limiting
- Real-time intrusion detection and log analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Phase 3: Deployment & Compliance

- Docker/Kubernetes deployment templates
- Terraform scripts for secure infrastructure
- Automated security audits and SBOM generation
- Developer documentation and threat modeling examples

## Example Code Snippets

### Password Hashing (bcrypt)

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 12;

async function hashPassword(password) {
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
}

async function verifyPassword(password, hash) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
}
```

### Input Sanitization Middleware (Express)

```javascript
const sanitize = require('sanitize-html');

function sanitizeInput(req, res, next) {
  for (const key in req.body) {
    if (typeof req.body[key] === 'string') {
      req.body[key] = sanitize(req.body[key]);
    }
  }
  next();
}
```

### Security Headers Middleware (Express)

```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
```

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies for frontend and backend
- Run backend server and frontend dashboard
- Configure environment variables for API keys and database

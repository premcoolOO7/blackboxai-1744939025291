# Upgraded Prompt for Master Photo Editor Pro

Design an intuitive, AI-driven photo editing platform that empowers users of all skill levels to create professional-quality visuals effortlessly. The tool should integrate advanced AI capabilities to automate complex tasks while offering granular manual controls for customization. Key features must include:

## Smart Editing Suite:
- **Background Manipulation**: One-click background removal/replacement with AI-powered edge detection and context-aware fill.
- **Object Enhancement**: Auto-detect and suggest optimizations for objects (e.g., brightness, contrast, focus). Allow AI-generated object additions/removals via text prompts (e.g., 'Add a sunset sky').
- **Style Transfer**: Apply artistic filters or match the style of a reference image using AI.

## Content Generation & Adaptation:
- **Text-to-Image**: Generate high-quality images from text descriptions (e.g., 'A minimalist logo with a blue owl').
- **Magic Resize**: Auto-adjust designs for multiple formats (social media, print, etc.) while preserving key elements.
- **Template Engine**: Suggest templates based on image content, purpose (e.g., ads, posters), or user preferences.

## Automated Optimization:
- **AI Enhance**: Single-click fixes for lighting, color balance, and sharpness, with adjustable intensity sliders.
- **Smart Composition**: Analyze images and suggest cropping, alignment, or layout improvements.
- **Batch Processing**: Apply edits/filters to multiple images simultaneously with AI-preset workflows.

## Collaboration & Accessibility:
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing with AI-powered version control and feedback integration.
- **Contextual Tutorials**: Offer tooltips or mini-guides based on user actions (e.g., 'Try this filter for warmer tones').
- **Cross-Platform**: Web, desktop, and mobile apps with cloud sync.

## Output & Integration:
- **Export in multiple formats** (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF) with adjustable resolution.
- **Direct publishing** to social media, CMS platforms, or cloud storage.
- **API support** for embedding tools into third-party apps.

## User Experience Guidelines:
- Prioritize a drag-and-drop interface with AI previews (before/after effects).
- Balance automation with creative freedom: Users can accept/reject AI suggestions.
- Include a 'Search for Design Elements' bar (e.g., 'Find transparent PNGs of trees').
- Offer brand-kit integration (AI applies user-specific colors/fonts automatically).
- Ensure the platform is accessible to non-designers while providing advanced settings (e.g., layer editing, hex codes) for professionals. Use natural language processing to interpret editing requests (e.g., 'Make this pop' triggers contrast/color adjustments).

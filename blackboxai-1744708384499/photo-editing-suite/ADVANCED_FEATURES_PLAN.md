# Advanced Features Implementation Plan for PhotoMaster Pro

## Objective
Add advanced AI-powered and professional photo editing features to the PhotoMaster Pro tool, including liquify, clone stamp, frequency separation, face detection, AI portrait retouching, and more.

## Features to Implement
- Liquify (reshape facial features)
- Clone Stamp / Healing Brush (blemish removal)
- Frequency Separation (skin retouching)
- Resynthesizer (object removal)
- Warp Transform (adjust face shape)
- Face Detection (auto-adjustments)
- Advanced retouching brushes
- Age/gender changes, smile addition, hairstyle swaps
- Enhance low-quality photos, sharpen facial details
- AI portrait retouching, background adjustments
- Face reshaping, skin smoothing, virtual makeup
- Auto-fix tools, artistic overlays
- Skin retouching, acne removal, face contouring
- AR filters (eye enlargement, cheekbone highlighting)
- 3D face sculpting, texture painting
- Detailed facial structure adjustments, mesh creation
- Advanced deepfake creation (synthetic faces)
- Auto-smoothing, skin texture enhancement
- Video face retouching, batch processing

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Core Image Processing and AI Integration
- Evaluate existing core scripts (JS and Python) for reuse and extension.
- Integrate AI models for face detection, portrait retouching, and deepfake generation.
- Implement or integrate image processing algorithms for liquify, clone stamp, frequency separation, etc.
- Use WebAssembly or server-side processing for performance-intensive tasks.

### 2. UI Components Development
- Create React components for each feature with intuitive controls.
- Implement non-destructive editing support with layers, masks, and history.
- Provide real-time preview and undo/redo functionality.
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling.

### 3. Integration and Navigation
- Add new features to the sidebar navigation in App.jsx.
- Ensure smooth transitions and state management between features.
- Integrate AI backend calls and processing pipelines.

### 4. Testing and Optimization
- Test each feature for accuracy, performance, and usability.
- Optimize image processing for responsiveness.
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design.

### 5. Documentation and User Guidance
- Update user manuals and tooltips.
- Provide sample images and tutorials for advanced features.

## Dependencies and Tools
- TensorFlow.js or ONNX.js for AI models in browser.
- OpenCV.js for image processing.
- WebAssembly modules for performance.
- Backend AI services if needed (Python scripts).

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core AI and image processing integration (4-6 weeks)
- Phase 2: UI components and feature development (4-6 weeks)
- Phase 3: Integration, testing, and optimization (2-4 weeks)
- Phase 4: Documentation and release (1-2 weeks)
